oops 
    Introduction to oops concept
        what is class and objects
        how to define class 
        how to create objects
        variables and methods in oops
        reference  variable 
    constructor (__init__)
        what is constructor
        why and what happens when we call constructor
    types of variable
        instance variable = variable which are intialized at the time of object creation   
            how to declare and in how many ways we can declare   
            how to delete 
            how to access and how to modify
        static/class variable= values which remains same from object to object are called static or class variable
            how to declare and in how many ways we can declare   
            how to delete 
            how to access and how to modify
        local variable = variable which are declared inside methods and that are deleted after execution 
            how to declare and in how many ways we can do that
            how to delete 
            where can we acces and modify
    types of methods 
        instance method= we declare instance variables iniside method and if we pass first variable as self 
        class method = we declare static variable inside method and pass cls as first variable and will decorate that method with classmethod using decorator
        static method = we wont pass cls or slef as first variable and we decorate that method with static method using decoarter
    inner class 
            similar to that nested loops and all , it is same it will be having class and inside we will be having another class 
    Difference b/w Constructor and method
        
    Inheritance = 
        types of Inheritance
            Single Inheritance
            multiple Inheritance
            multi-level Inheritance
            herichical Inheritance
